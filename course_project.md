# Course Project

## Lab Hardware

- 2x Franka Research 3 Robots
- 4x Intel Realsense D435i RGB-D Cameras
- Variety of objects to manipulate
- Desktop Computer with:
  - AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5965WX
  - 2x NVidia 4090s

## Project Proposal
The project proposal is a 1-2 page document with the following information:
- Team members (up to 3 people can work together)
- Project Description (up to 500 words).
  This should describe the intended demonstration and behavior of the final robot system that you will be building.
  That is, want to do with the robots?
  This can be anything from picking up objects, deploying an algorithm that you have seen in another paper, having the robots play tic-tac-toe, etc.
  Feel free to ask me for ideas or feedback if you are unsure whether or not a project will be feasible or not.
  If you are already doing a research project, I'm happy to try and have this project try to integrate into what you are already trying to do.
  If there is a different robot platform than the FR3s that you would like to use and your lab has the hardware, we can also discuss.
- Project Architecture (a diagram or description).
  This should discuss what software (or proposed software modules) will be implemented, how is it connected, and so forth.
  An abstract diagram would be appropriate, with node descriptions and type of messages sent between nodes.
  You should also specify libraries or other tools are you planning to use, if you already know.
  This can also be left vague if you are uncertain of the precise software at this time.
- Simulation Watermark.
  This is a description of what will prove feasibility of the simulated approach to begin testing on the real robot platform.
  There should be a detailed description of the exact scenario you are presenting in simulation and a written justificiation of why this proves feasibility for deployment on the real system (e.g., demonstrates safety, demonstrates feasibility of trajectories, etc.).
